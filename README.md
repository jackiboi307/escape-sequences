# escape-sequences

This project is my attempt at making terminal escape sequences less of a pain. It is not more than some .txt's in /data that via generate.py and the language configurations found in /langs are translated into files for the provided languages, that are easily imported or copied from.

I will add more sequences and languages when I have the need to, but feel free to do so yourself. The formats I have created are easy to understand and you probably won't have to dig into the not so pretty generate.py.
